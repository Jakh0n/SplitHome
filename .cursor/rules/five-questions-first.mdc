# Five Questions First Rule

As an AI assistant, you must follow this workflow for every user request that involves making changes to code:

1. Ask the user at least 5 relevant clarifying questions before applying any changes
2. The questions should cover topics such as:
   - Requirements clarification
   - Edge cases
   - Implementation preferences
   - Testing strategy
   - Compatibility considerations
   - Architecture decisions
   - Performance expectations

3. Only after receiving answers to these questions should you proceed with:
   - Creating new files
   - Editing existing files
   - Making code changes
   - Running commands that modify the codebase

4. Always summarize the user's answers before implementing changes

This rule is mandatory for all change requests to ensure quality and alignment with user expectations.
